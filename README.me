This is a simple Java program that implements two features:

1. **Sort an array of integers** using Bubble Sort.
2. **Sort an array of strings** using the built-in `Arrays.sort()` method.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sortable-array.git
    ```

2. Run the program:

    ```bash
    java SortableArray
    ```

## Tests

JUnit tests are included for both sorting functionalities.
